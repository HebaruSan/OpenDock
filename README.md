## OpenDock
OpenDock is an open source frontend for the [SpaceDock-Backend](https://github.com/KSP-SpaceDock/SpaceDock-Backend) software, an API backend for hosting game modifications.
This is an unofficial project by SpaceDock-Backend developers to create a testbed where the communication between backend and frontend can be researched, until the real frontend for SpaceDock gets finished.
**It is not and will not be the official UI.** Use this at your own risk - you will probably need to do a lot of changes to adapt it to your needs and we wont support it like we support the official SpaceDock applications.
